<h1> User Registration and Authentication System </h1>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p> The system I developed using React.js and Node.js provides an efficient and secure solution for user registration and authentication. This application is essential for various contexts, from institutional websites to more complex platforms, offering a user-friendly and robust user experience.</p>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>

<li> React.js: We used React.js to build the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive experience. The structure of reusable components and the architecture based on unidirectional data flow (Flux) contribute to efficient and scalable development.</li><br>

<li>Node.js: Choosing Node.js as the backend ensures efficient and asynchronous execution, ideal for input/output-intensive operations such as processing user authentication and registration requests.</li>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<h3>User Registration:</h3>

<li> The system allows new users to register by providing essential information such as name, email, and password.</li><br>
<li>Passwords are securely stored, using hashing techniques to ensure confidentiality.</li>

<h3>Authentication:</h3>

<li>Registered users can log in using their email and password.</li><br>
<li>The system employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, providing an additional layer of security.</li>

<h3>Route Protection:</h3>

<li>Sensitive routes, such as the user dashboard, are protected to ensure that only authenticated users have access.</li><br>
<li>Frontend integration with the backend is done securely, preventing unauthorized access.</li>

<h3>User Feedback:</h3>

The system provides clear feedback to the user during the registration and authentication process, improving the user experience.

<h2>Architecture:</h2>
he application architecture is based on a client-server approach, where the React.js frontend communicates asynchronously with the Node.js server through HTTP requests. The server manages secure data storage and authentication logic.
